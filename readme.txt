Basic User Registration and Authentication Form in Django

This project involves creating a simple user registration and authentication system using Django, a high-level Python web framework. The key components include:

Project Setup: Initialize a new Django project and app.
Configuration: Update settings.py to include the new app and configure the database.
User Model: Utilize Django’s built-in User model for managing user data.
Forms: Create a registration form using Django’s forms module to handle user input.
Views: Develop views to manage the registration and login processes.
Templates: Design HTML templates for the registration and login forms.
URLs: Define URL patterns to route requests to the appropriate views.
Server: Run the Django development server to test the application.
This setup allows users to register by providing a username, email, and password, and then log in using their credentials. The system ensures that passwords are securely hashed and stored.
